# EarthView

Sets a random satellite image from [Earth View with Google](http://earthview.withgoogle.com) as a wallpaper.

The dataset of the satellite images are scrapped beforehand using a script (see `install.js`) by calling multiple network requests. Feel free to fetch those images again.

## Usage
```
npm install -g earthview
earthview
```
